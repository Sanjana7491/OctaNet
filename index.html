            <p id="tribute-info">Ratan Naval Tata (born 28 December 1937) is an Indian industrialist, philanthropist and former chairman of Tata Sons. He was a chairman of the Tata Group from 1990 to 2012, and interim chairman from October 2016 through February 2017. He continues
                to head its charitable trusts.In 2008, he received the Padma Vibhushan, the second highest civilian honour in India, after receiving the Padma Bhushan, the third highest civilian honour in 2000.He is the son of Naval Tata, who was adopted
                by Ratanji Tata, son of Jamsetji Tata, the founder of the Tata Group. He graduated from the Cornell University College of Architecture with a bachelor's degree in architecture.He joined Tata in 1961, where he worked on the shop floor of
                Tata Steel. He later succeeded J. R. D. Tata as chairman of Tata Sons upon the latter's retirement in 1991. Under his tenure the Tata Group acquired Tetley, Jaguar Land Rover, and Corus, in an attempt to turn Tata from a largely India-centric
                group into a global business. Tata is also one of the largest philanthropists in the world, having donated around 60â€“65% of his income to charity.</p>
            <p id="tribute-info">In the 1970s Tata was given a managerial position in the Tata group. He achieved initial success by turning the subsidiary National Radio and Electronics (NELCO) around, only to see it collapse during an economic slowdown.In 1991, J. R. D.
                Tata stepped down as chairman of Tata Sons, naming him his successor. Initially, Tata faced stiff resistance from the heads of various subsidiaries, who had a large amount of operational freedom under the senior Tata's tenure. In response,
                Tata implemented a number of policies designed to consolidate power, including the implementation of a retirement age, having subsidiaries report directly to the group office, and requiring subsidiaries to contribute their profit to building
                the Tata group brand. Tata prioritised innovation and delegated many responsibilities to younger talent.[17] Under his leadership, overlapping operations between subsidiaries were streamlined into company-wide operations, with the group
                exiting unrelated businesses to take on globalisation.</p>
